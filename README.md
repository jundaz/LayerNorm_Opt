# LayerNorm_Opt
How LayerNorm helps optimization

This project explores how LayerNorm help with Transformer training and if it provide similar effectiveness as batchNorm for VGG

Dataset for Transformer used: IWSLT German-English

To start training you need to download and uncompress the dataset first

VGG part based on implementation by AlexeyGB@github, link to repo:
